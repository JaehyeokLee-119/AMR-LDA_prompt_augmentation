The side leading to the seaport has worn faster, even though each side has carried virtually the same amount of traffic, consisting mainly of large trucks.","question":"Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference in the rate of wear?","answers":["Wear on the side of the highway that leads to Rittland's seaport has encouraged people to take buses to the seaport rather than driving there in their own automobiles.","A greater tonnage of goods is exported from Rittland's seaport than is imported through it.","The volume of traffic to and from Rittland's seaport has increased beyond the intended capacity of the highway that serves it.","All of Rittland's automobiles are imported by ship."],"label":"B","others":null}

The scientific components are the complicated mathematics and the astronomical knowledge needed to create an astrological chart.
